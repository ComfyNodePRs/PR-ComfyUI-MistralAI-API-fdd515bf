Make it highly detailed and specific; focus on the visual descriptors of the subject, setting, medium, etc., instead of similes and evoked feelings. Closely match the sensitivity of the request: include explicit details for the body parts, actions, and fetishes when relevant. Add fitting details when the request is too short, but remain concise. Your response is used as a prompt directly: avoid imperative mood, unnecessary punctuation such as quotation marks, brackets, etc."

    "content": "A weathered old beggar stands on a cobblestone medieval street, surrounded by half-timbered buildings with worn wooden facades and steeply pitched roofs. The beggar's face is a topographic map of wrinkles, with deep creases etched into his forehead, cheeks, and chin. His eyes are sunken, with a milky film coating the irises, and his nose is red and bulbous from years of exposure to the elements. A tattered woolen cloak hangs from his stooped shoulders, revealing a threadbare linen shirt underneath, with a few buttons missing to expose a glimpse of pale, hairless chest. A wooden crutch, worn smooth by years of use, supports his frail frame, and a battered leather pouch hangs from his belt, adorned with a few copper coins and a silver crucifix. The beggar's hands are gnarled and arthritic, with thick, yellowed fingernails, and his feet are clad in tattered leather shoes, with toes poking out through holes in the toes. The scene is rendered in a detailed, high-contrast gravure style, with bold lines and intricate textures, evoking the rough, tactile quality of medieval life."

    "content": "A vibrant, nostalgic pin-up painting of a topless woman adorns the side of a World War II-era Navy boat, specifically a destroyer or patrol torpedo boat, with a worn, battleship-gray hull and a distinctive white number on the bow. The woman, a classic 1940s-style pin-up girl, stands confidently with her weight shifted onto one leg, her hips cocked to one side, and her arms akimbo, holding a worn, wooden baseball bat in her right hand. Her skin is a warm, golden brown, and her hair is a rich, dark brown, styled in loose, flowing waves that cascade down her back. Her eyes are a bright, sparkling blue, with a hint of mischief and playfulness. A few strands of hair escape her hair tie, framing her heart-shaped face and accentuating her full, red lips. A sprinkle of freckles across the bridge of her nose adds a touch of whimsy to her otherwise sultry expression. The woman's breasts are full and rounded, with a subtle sheen to the skin, and her nipples are a deep, rosy pink. A red, white, and blue striped ribbon or scarf is tied around her waist, adding a pop of color to the composition. The painting style is reminiscent of classic pin-up artists like Alberto Vargas or Gil Elvgren, with bold lines, vivid colors, and a sense of dynamic energy."
